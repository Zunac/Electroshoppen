## What is Electroshoppen?
This is a local, simulated webshob made in Java. The webshop is intended to simulate a client-server platform with separated PIM (Product Information Management) and POS (Point of sale) systems. These are separated to simulate the data sources (database management) found in a real life webshop.

## What have I learned?
* To utilize a local client-server setup (with a SQL database) in Java.
* How to process the data in the database using separate 'systems' (PIM and POS) found in a real-life webshop.
